/* I will be using C to try and make a simple terminal game. I will try and use arrays, and stuff like that
for the inventory and things like that. I think I want it to be a simple adventure game. Maybe I can learn
how to make games and then make one with someone!

I can make a big state machine, where the state defines what weapon and choices they have taken so far... but that 
would get dirty really quickly and not be very fun. I can try and make graphics using ASCII somehow*/
