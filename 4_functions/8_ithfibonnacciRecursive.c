/* This is a C program where I will make a program to find the ith number in the fibonacci series in C using recursive 
functions

So it's not just simply create a fibonacci sequence, but it's make a recursive function that takes a number and returns the ith
value in the sequence. The fibonacci sequence is basically : the next number is the sum of the previous 2 numbers. Ok So all I have
to do is keep summing the last 2 numbers n times... easy I think

n = fib(n-1/2) + fib(n-1/2) which should be fine I think? I'll have to look into the relationship a little bit closer I guess

	return 0;

long fibonacci(long n)

	if (n == 1) return 0;
